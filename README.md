# World Cup 2026 Sweepstakes

A web app for a 12-person, 4-teams-each World Cup sweepstakes.

## Features

- **The Draw** — a spinning wheel of fortune reveals each player's team pot by pot. The drawn team shows an infographic card (FIFA ranking, pot, group, assigned player). Picked teams disappear from the wheel as the draw progresses.
- **Standings** — leaderboard with points, goal difference, and teams alive. Click a player to see their four teams.
- **Bracket** — knockout bracket (Phase 2, before ~28 Jun).
